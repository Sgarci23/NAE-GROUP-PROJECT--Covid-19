# NAE-GROUP-PROJECT--Covid-19
A group project done in matlab that allows the user to view and update data concerning covid-19.
This was my group's submission to the NAE Grand Challenge.
It takes in data of the number of cases reported per day and allows the user to do a few things with it.
We give the user a menu with a few options:
to view the max number of cases in a state,
 the rate of cases in the United States overall or in a selected state
, the average number of cases per day
, a graph of these cases either in the United States or in a selected state.
, and allows the user to enter in new data
